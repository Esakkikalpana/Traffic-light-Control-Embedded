# Traffic-light-Control-Embedded
This project is a Traffic Light Control System designed for a four-way intersection using an Embedded System. It is developed in CCS C and simulated using Proteus. The system efficiently manages traffic signals using positive logic for two directions and negative logic for the other two directions.
